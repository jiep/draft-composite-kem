Composite ML-KEM for Use in the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure
                                and CMS
                draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-kem-latest

Abstract

   This document introduces a set of Key Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM)
   schemes that use pairs of cryptographic elements such as public keys
   and cipher texts to combine their security properties.  These schemes
   effectively mitigate risks associated with the adoption of post-
   quantum cryptography and are fully compatible with existing X.509,
   PKIX, and CMS data structures and protocols.  This document defines
   eleven specific pairwise combinations, namely ML-KEM Composite
   Schemes, that blend ML-KEM with traditional algorithms such as RSA-
   OAEP, ECDH, X25519, and X448.  For use within CMS, this document is
   intended to be coupled with the CMS KEMRecipientInfo mechanism in
   [I-D.housley-lamps-cms-kemri].  These combinations are tailored to
   meet security best practices and regulatory requirements.

1.  Changes in version -05

   *  Fixed a bug in the definition of the Encaps() functions: KEMs,
      according to both RFC9180 and FIPS 203 should always return (ss,
      ct), but we had (ct, ss).

   Still to do in a future version:

   *  [ ] We need PEM samples ... hackathon?  OQS friends?  David @ BC?
      The right format for samples is probably to follow the hackathon
      ... a Dilithium or ECDSA trust anchor certificate, a composite KEM
      end entity certificate, and a CMS EnvelopedData sample encrypted
      for that composite KEM certificate.

   *  [ ] Open question: do we need to include the ECDH, X25519, X448,
      and RSA public keys in the KDF?  X-Wing does, but previous
      versions of this spec do not.  In general existing ECC and RSA
      hardware decrypter implementations might not know their own public
      key.

2.  Introduction

   The advent of quantum computing poses a significant threat to current
   cryptographic systems.  Traditional cryptographic algorithms such as
   RSA-OAEP, ECDH and their elliptic curve variants are vulnerable to
   quantum attacks.  During the transition to post-quantum cryptography
   (PQC), there is considerable uncertainty regarding the robustness of
   both existing and new cryptographic algorithms.  While we can no
   longer fully trust traditional cryptography, we also cannot
   immediately place complete trust in post-quantum replacements until
   they have undergone extensive scrutiny and real-world testing to
   uncover and rectify potential implementation flaws.

   Unlike previous migrations between cryptographic algorithms, the
   decision of when to migrate and which algorithms to adopt is far from
   straightforward.  Even after the migration period, it may be
   advantageous for an entity's cryptographic identity to incorporate
   multiple public-key algorithms to enhance security.

   Cautious implementers may opt to combine cryptographic algorithms in
   such a way that an attacker would need to break all of them
   simultaneously to compromise the protected data.  These mechanisms
   are referred to as Post-Quantum/Traditional (PQ/T) Hybrids
   [I-D.driscoll-pqt-hybrid-terminology].

   Certain jurisdictions are already recommending or mandating that PQC
   lattice schemes be used exclusively within a PQ/T hybrid framework.
   The use of Composite scheme provides a straightforward implementation
   of hybrid solutions compatible with (and advocated by) some
   governments and cybersecurity agencies [BSI2021].

   In addition, [BSI2021] specifically references this specification as
   a concrete example of hybrid X.509 certificates.

   A more recent example is [ANSSI2024], a document co-authored by
   French Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI), Federal Office for Information
   Security (BSI), Netherlands National Communications Security Agency
   (NLNCSA), and Swedish National Communications Security Authority,
   Swedish Armed Forces which makes the following statement:

      "In light of the urgent need to stop relying only on quantum-
      vulnerable public-key cryptography for key establishment, the
      clear priority should therefore be the migration to post-quantum
      cryptography in hybrid solutions"

   This specification represents the straightforward implementation of
   the hybrid solutions called for by European cyber security agencies.

   PQ/T Hybrid cryptography can, in general, provide solutions to two
   migration problems:

   *  Algorithm strength uncertainty: During the transition period, some
      post-quantum signature and encryption algorithms will not be fully
      trusted, while also the trust in legacy public key algorithms will
      start to erode.  A relying party may learn some time after
      deployment that a public key algorithm has become untrustworthy,
      but in the interim, they may not know which algorithm an adversary
      has compromised.

   *  Ease-of-migration: During the transition period, systems will
      require mechanisms that allow for staged migrations from fully
      classical to fully post-quantum-aware cryptography.

   This document defines a specific instantiation of the PQ/T Hybrid
   paradigm called "composite" where multiple cryptographic algorithms
   are combined to form a single key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) key
   and ciphertext such that they can be treated as a single atomic
   algorithm at the protocol level.  Composite algorithms address
   algorithm strength uncertainty because the composite algorithm
   remains strong so long as one of its components remains strong.
   Concrete instantiations of composite KEM algorithms are provided
   based on ML-KEM, RSA-OAEP and ECDH.  Backwards compatibility is not
   directly covered in this document, but is the subject of
   Appendix C.2.

   This document is intended for general applicability anywhere that key
   establishment or enveloped content encryption is used within PKIX or
   CMS structures.

2.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document is consistent with all terminology from
   [I-D.driscoll-pqt-hybrid-terminology].  In addition, the following
   terms are used in this document:

   *COMBINER:* A combiner specifies how multiple shared secrets are
   combined into a single shared secret.

   *DER:* Distinguished Encoding Rules as defined in [X.690].

   *KEM:* A key encapsulation mechanism as defined in Section 2.3.

   *PKI:* Public Key Infrastructure, as defined in [RFC5280].

   *SHARED SECRET:* A value established between two communicating
   parties for use as cryptographic key material, but which cannot be
   learned by an active or passive adversary.  This document is
   concerned with shared secrets established via public key
   cryptographic operations.

2.2.  Composite Design Philosophy

   [I-D.driscoll-pqt-hybrid-terminology] defines composites as:

      _Composite Cryptographic Element_: A cryptographic element that
      incorporates multiple component cryptographic elements of the same
      type in a multi-algorithm scheme.

   Composite keys, as defined here, follow this definition and should be
   regarded as a single key that performs a single cryptographic
   operation such as key generation, signing, verifying, encapsulating,
   or decapsulating -- using its internal sequence of component keys as
   if they form a single key.  This generally means that the complexity
   of combining algorithms can and should be handled by the
   cryptographic library or cryptographic module, and the single
   composite public key, private key, and ciphertext can be carried in
   existing fields in protocols such as PKCS#10 [RFC2986], CMP
   [RFC4210], X.509 [RFC5280], CMS [RFC5652], and the Trust Anchor
   Format [RFC5914].  In this way, composites achieve "protocol
   backwards-compatibility" in that they will drop cleanly into any
   protocol that accepts KEM algorithms without requiring any
   modification of the protocol to handle multiple keys.

2.3.  Composite Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs)

   We borrow here the definition of a key encapsulation mechanism (KEM)
   from [I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design], in which a KEM is a cryptographic
   primitive that consists of three algorithms:

   *  KeyGen() -> (pk, sk): A probabilistic key generation algorithm,
      which generates a public key pk and a secret key sk.

   *  Encaps(pk) -> (ss, ct): A probabilistic encapsulation algorithm,
      which takes as input a public key pk and outputs a ciphertext ct
      and shared secret ss.

   *  Decaps(sk, ct) -> ss: A decapsulation algorithm, which takes as
      input a secret key sk and ciphertext ct and outputs a shared
      secret ss, or in some cases a distinguished error value.

   The KEM interface defined above differs from both traditional key
   transport mechanism (for example for use with KeyTransRecipientInfo
   defined in [RFC5652]), and key agreement (for example for use with
   KeyAgreeRecipientInfo defined in [RFC5652]).

   The KEM interface was chosen as the interface for a composite key
   establishment because it allows for arbitrary combinations of
   component algorithm types since both key transport and key agreement
   mechanisms can be promoted into KEMs.  This specification uses the
   Post-Quantum KEM ML-KEM as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-kyber-certificates] and [FIPS.203-ipd].  For
   Traditional KEMs, this document uses the RSA-OAEP algorithm defined
   in [RFC3560], the Elliptic Curve Diffie-Hellman key agreement schemes
   ECDH defined in section 5.7.1.2 of [SP.800-56Ar3], and X25519 / X448
   which are defined in [RFC8410].  A combiner function is used to
   combine the two component shared secrets into a single shared secret.

2.3.1.  Composite KeyGen

   The KeyGen() -> (pk, sk) of a composite KEM algorithm will perform
   the KeyGen() of the respective component KEM algorithms and it
   produces a composite public key pk as per Section 3.2 and a composite
   secret key sk is per Section 3.3.

   CompositeKEM.KeyGen():
     (compositePK[0], compositeSK[0]) = MLKEM.KeyGen()
     (compositePK[1], compositeSK[1]) = TradKEM.KeyGen()

     return (compositePK, compositeSK)

2.3.2.  Promotion of RSA-OAEP into a KEM

   The RSA Optimal Asymmetric Encryption Padding (OAEP), more
   specifically the RSAES-OAEP key transport algorithm as specified in
   [RFC3560] is a public key encryption algorithm used to transport key
   material from a sender to a receiver.  It is promoted into a KEM by
   having the sender generate a random 256 bit secret and encrypt it.

   RSAOAEPKEM.Encaps(pkR):
     shared_secret = SecureRandom(ss_len)
     enc = RSA-OAEP.Encrypt(pkR, shared_secret)

     return shared_secret, enc

   Decaps(sk, ct) -> ss is accomplished in the analogous way.

   RSAKEM.Decap(skR, enc):
     shared_secret = RSA-OAEP.Decrypt(skR, enc)

     return shared_secret

   The value of ss_len as well as the RSA-OAEP parameters used within
   this specification can be found in Section 5.2.

2.3.3.  Promotion of ECDH into a KEM

   An elliptic curve Diffie-Hellman key agreement is promoted into a KEM
   Encaps(pk) -> (ss, ct) using a simplified version of the DHKEM
   definition from [RFC9180].

   DHKEM.Encaps(pkR):
     skE, pkE = GenerateKeyPair()
     shared_secret = DH(skE, pkR)
     enc = SerializePublicKey(pkE)

     return shared_secret, enc

   Decaps(sk, ct) -> ss is accomplished in the analogous way.

   DHKEM.Decap(skR, enc):
     pkE = DeserializePublicKey(enc)
     shared_secret = DH(skR, pkE)

     return shared_secret

   This construction applies for all variants of elliptic curve Diffie-
   Hellman used in this specification: ECDH, X25519, and X448.

   The simplifications from the DHKEM definition in [RFC9180] is that
   since the ciphertext and receiver's public key are included
   explicitly in the composite KEM combiner, there is no need to
   construct the kem_context object, and since a domain separator is
   included explicitly in the composite KEM combiner there is no need to
   perform the labelled steps of ExtractAndExpand().

2.3.4.  Composite Encaps

   The Encaps(pk) -> (ss, ct) of a composite KEM algorithm is defined
   as:

   CompositeKEM.Encaps(pk):
     # Split the component public keys
     mlkemPK = pk[0]
     tradPK  = pk[1]

     # Perform the respective component Encaps operations
     (mlkemCT, mlkemSS) = MLKEM.Encaps(mlkemPK)
     (tradCT, tradSS) = TradKEM.Encaps(tradPK)

     # Combine
     # note that the order of the traditional and ML-KEM components
     # is flipped here in order to satisfy NIST SP800-56Cr2.
     ct = CompositeCiphertextValue(mlkemCT, tradCT)
     ss = Combiner(tradSS, mlkemSS, tradCT, tradPK, domSep)

     return (ss, ct)

   where Combiner(tradSS, mlkemSS, tradCT, tradPK, domSep) is defined in
   general in Section 4.3 with specific values for domSep per composite
   KEM algorithm in Section 5 and CompositeCiphertextValue is defined in
   Section 4.2.

2.3.5.  Composite Decaps

   The Decaps(sk, ct) -> ss of a composite KEM algorithm is defined as:

   CompositeKEM.Decaps(ct, mlkemSK, tradSK):
     # split the component ciphertexts
     mlkemCT = ct[0]
     tradCT  = ct[1]

     # Perform the respective component Decaps operations
     mlkemSS = MLKEM.Decaps(mlkemSK, mlkemCT)
     tradSS  = TradKEM.Decaps(tradSK, tradCT)

     # Combine
     # note that the order of the traditional and ML-KEM components
     # is flipped here in order to satisfy NIST SP800-56Cr2.
     ss = Combiner(tradSS, mlkemSS, tradCT, tradPK, domSep)

     return ss

   where Combiner(tradSS, mlkemSS, tradCT, tradPK, domSep) is defined in
   general in Section 4.3 with specific values for domSep per composite
   KEM algorithm in Section 5.  CompositeCiphertextValue is defined in
   Section 4.2.

   Here the secret key values mlkemSK and tradSK may be interpreted as
   either literal secret key values, or as a handle to a cryptographic
   module which holds the secret key and is capable of performing the
   secret key operation.

3.  Composite Key Structures

3.1.  pk-CompositeKEM

   The following ASN.1 Information Object Class is a template to be used
   in defining all composite KEM public key types.

   pk-CompositeKEM {
     OBJECT IDENTIFIER:id, FirstPublicKeyType,
     SecondPublicKeyType} PUBLIC-KEY ::=
     {
       IDENTIFIER id
       KEY SEQUENCE {
        BIT STRING (CONTAINING FirstPublicKeyType)
        BIT STRING (CONTAINING SecondPublicKeyType)
       }
       PARAMS ARE absent
       CERT-KEY-USAGE { keyEncipherment }
     }

   As an example, the public key type pk-MLKEM512-ECDH-P256 is defined
   as:

   pk-MLKEM512-ECDH-P256 PUBLIC-KEY ::=
     pk-CompositeKEM {
       id-MLKEM512-ECDH-P256,
       OCTET STRING, ECPoint }

   The full set of key types defined by this specification can be found
   in the ASN.1 Module in Section 7.

3.2.  CompositeKEMPublicKey

   Composite public key data is represented by the following structure:

   CompositeKEMPublicKey ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2) OF BIT STRING

   A composite key MUST contain two component public keys.  The order of
   the component keys is determined by the definition of the
   corresponding algorithm identifier as defined in section Section 5.

   Some applications may need to reconstruct the SubjectPublicKeyInfo
   objects corresponding to each component public key.  Table 1 in
   Section 5 provides the necessary mapping between composite and their
   component algorithms for doing this reconstruction.  This also
   motivates the design choice of SEQUENCE OF BIT STRING instead of
   SEQUENCE OF OCTET STRING; using BIT STRING allows for easier
   transcription between CompositeKEMPublicKey and SubjectPublicKeyInfo.

   When the CompositeKEMPublicKey must be provided in octet string or
   bit string format, the data structure is encoded as specified in
   Section 3.4.

3.3.  CompositeKEMPrivateKey

   Use cases that require an inter-operable encoding for composite
   private keys, such as when private keys are carried in PKCS #12
   [RFC7292], CMP [RFC4210] or CRMF [RFC4211] MUST use the following
   structure.

   CompositeKEMPrivateKey ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2) OF OneAsymmetricKey

   Each element is a OneAsymmetricKey` [RFC5958] object for a component
   private key.

   The parameters field MUST be absent.

   The order of the component keys is the same as the order defined in
   Section 3.2 for the components of CompositeKEMPublicKey.

   When a CompositePrivateKey is conveyed inside a OneAsymmetricKey
   structure (version 1 of which is also known as PrivateKeyInfo)
   [RFC5958], the privateKeyAlgorithm field SHALL be set to the
   corresponding composite algorithm identifier defined according to
   Section 5, the privateKey field SHALL contain the
   CompositeKEMPrivateKey, and the publicKey field MUST NOT be present.
   Associated public key material MAY be present in the
   CompositeKEMPrivateKey.

   In some use-cases the private keys that comprise a composite key may
   not be represented in a single structure or even be contained in a
   single cryptographic module; for example if one component is within
   the FIPS boundary of a cryptographic module and the other is not; see
   Appendix C.1 for more discussion.  The establishment of
   correspondence between public keys in a CompositeKEMPublicKey and
   private keys not represented in a single composite structure is
   beyond the scope of this document.

3.4.  Encoding Rules

   Many protocol specifications will require that the composite public
   key and composite private key data structures be represented by an
   octet string or bit string.

   When an octet string is required, the DER encoding of the composite
   data structure SHALL be used directly.

   CompositeKEMPublicKeyOs ::= OCTET STRING (CONTAINING CompositeKEMPublicKey ENCODED BY der)

   When a bit string is required, the octets of the DER encoded
   composite data structure SHALL be used as the bits of the bit string,
   with the most significant bit of the first octet becoming the first
   bit, and so on, ending with the least significant bit of the last
   octet becoming the last bit of the bit string.

   CompositeKEMPublicKeyBs ::= BIT STRING (CONTAINING CompositeKEMPublicKey ENCODED BY der)

3.5.  Key Usage Bits

   For protocols such as X.509 [RFC5280] that specify key usage along
   with the public key, then the composite public key associated with a
   composite KEM algorithm MUST contain only a keyEncipherment key
   usage, all other key usages MUST NOT be used.  This is because the
   composite public key can only be used in situations that are
   appropriate for both component algorithms, so even if the classical
   component key supports both signing and encryption, the post-quantum
   algorithms do not.

4.  Composite KEM Structures

4.1.  kema-CompositeKEM

   The ASN.1 algorithm object for a composite KEM is:

   kema-CompositeKEM {
     OBJECT IDENTIFIER:id,
       PUBLIC-KEY:publicKeyType }
       KEM-ALGORITHM ::= {
            IDENTIFIER id
            VALUE CompositeCiphertextValue
            PARAMS ARE absent
            PUBLIC-KEYS { publicKeyType }
           }

4.2.  CompositeCiphertextValue

   The compositeCipherTextValue is a concatenation of the ciphertexts of
   the underlying component algorithms.  It is represented in ASN.1 as
   follows:

   CompositeCiphertextValue ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2) OF OCTET STRING

   The order of the component ciphertexts is the same as the order
   defined in Section 3.2.

4.3.  KEM Combiner

   TODO: as per https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/post-quantum-
   cryptography-integration-study section 4.2, might need to specify
   behaviour in light of KEMs with a non-zero failure probability.

   The KEM combiner construction is as follows:

   KEK = KDF(tradSS || mlkemSS || tradCT || tradPK ||
          domSep, outputBits)

                Figure 1: Generic KEM combiner construction

   where:

   *  KDF(message, outputBits) represents a hash function suitable to
      the chosen KEMs according to {tab-kem-combiners}.

   *  tradSS is the shared secret from the traditional component
      (elliptic curve or RSA).

   *  mlkemSS is the shared secret from the ML-KEM componont.

   *  tradCT is the ciphertext from the traditional component (elliptic
      curve or RSA).

   *  tradPK is the public key of the traditional component (elliptic
      curve or RSA).

   *  domSep SHALL be the DER encoded value of the object identifier of
      the composite KEM algorithm as listed in Section 5.1.

   *  || represents concatenation.

   Each registered composite KEM algorithm must specify the choice of
   KDF, demSep, and outputBits to be used.

   Some of the design choices for the combiner, specifically to place
   tradSS first, and to allow tradCT || tradPK || domSep to be treated
   together as a FixedInfo block are made for the purposes of compliance
   with [SP.800-56Cr2]; see Section 4.4 for more discussion.

   See Section 9.3 for further discussion of the security considerations
   of this KEM combiner.

4.4.  FIPS Compliance

   This specification is compliant with [SP.800-56Cr2] which allows for
   multiple sources of shared secret material to be combined into a
   single shared secret and the combined shared secret to be considered
   FIPS compliant so long as the first input shared secret is the result
   of a FIPS compliant algorithm.  In order to ease FIPS compliance
   issues during the transition period, this specification uses the
   traditional algorithm as the first input to the combiner so that the
   combiner is FIPS compliant so long as the traditional component is
   FIPS compliant.

   This construction is specifically designed to conform with
   Section 4.1 Option 1 (when KDF is SHA3) or Option 3 (when KDF is
   KMAC) in the following way:

   In both cases we match exactly the construction using the allowed
   "hybrid" shared secret of the form Z' = Z || T to yield the
   construction

   counter || Z || T || FixedInfo

   where:

   *  Z = tradSS is the algorithm assumed to always be FIPS-approved
      from a FIPS-certified implementation which is expected to be true
      during the period where organizations are migrating their existing
      deployments to add ML-KEM implementations which may not yet have
      received FIPS certification,

   *  T = mlkemSS, and

   *  FixedInfo = tradCT || tradPK || domSep.

   In the case that KDF is KMAC, the message to be hashed MUST be post-
   pended with H_outputBits and the byte string 01001011 || 01000100 ||
   01000110, which represents the sequence of characters "K", "D," and
   "F" in 8-bit ASCII, as required by [SP.800-56Cr2] section 4.1 Option
   3. salt is left empty since KMAC is only required to behave as a hash
   function and not as a keyed MAC.

5.  Algorithm Identifiers

   This table summarizes the list of composite KEM algorithms and lists
   the OID, two component algorithms, and the combiner function.

   EDNOTE: The OID referenced are TBD and MUST be used only for
   prototyping and replaced with the final IANA-assigned OIDs.  The
   following prefix is used for each: replace <CompKEM> with the String
   "2.16.840.1.114027.80.5.2".

   TODO: OIDs to be replaced by IANA.

   Therefore <CompKEM>.1 is equal to 2.16.840.1.114027.80.5.2.1

                      Table 1: Composite KEM key types

   Full specifications for the referenced algorithms can be found as
   follows:

   *  _ECDH_: There does not appear to be a single IETF definition of
      ECDH, so we refer to the following:

      -  _ECDH NIST_: SHALL be Elliptic Curve Cryptography Cofactor
         Diffie-Hellman (ECC CDH) as defined in section 5.7.1.2 of
         [SP.800-56Ar3].

      -  _ECDH BSI / brainpool_: SHALL be Elliptic Curve Key Agreement
         algorithm (ECKA) as defined in section 4.3.1 of [BSI-ECC]

   *  _ML-KEM_: [I-D.ietf-lamps-kyber-certificates] and [FIPS.203-ipd]

   *  _RSA-OAEP_: [RFC3560]

   *  _X25519 / X448_: [RFC8410]

   EDNOTE: I believe that [SP.800-56Ar3] and [BSI-ECC] give equivalent
   and inter-operable algorithms, so maybe this is extraneous detail to
   include?

5.1.  Domain Separators

   The KEM combiner defined in section Section 4.3 requires a domain
   separator domSep input.  The following table shows the HEX-encoded
   domain separator for each Composite KEM AlgorithmID; to use it, the
   value should be HEX-decoded and used in binary form.  The domain
   separator is simply the DER encoding of the composite algorithm OID.

   EDNOTE: Should the domain separator values be the SHA-256 hash of the
   DER encoding of the corresponding composite algorithm OID?  That way
   they would be fixed-length even if the OIDs are different lengths.
   See https://github.com/lamps-wg/draft-composite-sigs/issues/19

            Table 2: Composite KEM fixedInfo Domain Separators

   EDNOTE: these domain separators are based on the prototyping OIDs
   assigned on the Entrust arc.  We will need to ask for IANA early
   allocation of these OIDs so that we can re-compute the domain
   separators over the final OIDs.

5.2.  RSA-OAEP Parameters

   Use of RSA-OAEP [RFC3560] within id-MLKEM512-RSA2048 and id-
   MLKEM512-RSA3072 requires additional specification.

   First, a quick note on the choice of RSA-OAEP as the supported RSA
   encryption primitive.  RSA-KEM [RFC5990] is more straightforward to
   work with, but it has fairly limited adoption and therefore is of
   limited backwards compatibility value.  Also, while RSA-PKCS#1v1.5
   [RFC8017] is still everywhere, but hard to make secure and no longer
   FIPS-approved as of the end of 2023 [SP800-131Ar2], so it is of
   limited forwards value.  This leaves RSA-OAEP [RFC3560] as the
   remaining choice.

   The RSA component keys MUST be generated at the 2048-bit and 3072-bit
   security levels respectively.

   As with the other composite KEM algorithms, when id-MLKEM512-RSA2048
   or id-MLKEM512-RSA3072 is used in an AlgorithmIdentifier, the
   parameters MUST be absent.  The RSA-OAEP SHALL be instantiated with
   the following hard-coded parameters which are the same for both the
   2048 and 3072 bit security levels.

        +====================+===================================+
        | RSA-OAEP Parameter | Value                             |
        +====================+===================================+
        | hashFunc           | id-sha2-256                       |
        +--------------------+-----------------------------------+
        | maskGenFunc        | mgf1SHA256Identifier              |
        +--------------------+-----------------------------------+
        | pSourceFunc        | DEFAULT pSpecifiedEmptyIdentifier |
        +--------------------+-----------------------------------+
        | ss_len             | 256 bits                          |
        +--------------------+-----------------------------------+

                       Table 3: RSA-OAEP Parameters

   where:

   *  id-sha256 is defined in [RFC8017].

   *  mgf1SHA256Identifier is defined in [RFC4055].

   *  pSpecifiedEmptyIdentifier is defined in [RFC3560]

6.  Use in CMS

   [EDNOTE: The convention in LAMPS is to specify algorithms and their
   CMS conventions in separate documents.  Here we have presented them
   in the same document, but this section has been written so that it
   can easily be moved to a standalone document.]

   Composite KEM algorithms MAY be employed for one or more recipients
   in the CMS enveloped-data content type [RFC5652], the CMS
   authenticated-data content type [RFC5652], or the CMS authenticated-
   enveloped-data content type [RFC5083].  In each case, the
   KEMRecipientInfo [I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-kemri] is used with the chosen
   composite KEM Algorithm to securely transfer the content-encryption
   key from the originator to the recipient.

6.1.  Underlying Components

   A CMS implementation that supports a composite KEM algorithm MUST
   support at least the following underlying components:

   When a particular Composite KEM OID is supported, an implementation
   MUST support the corresponding KDF algorithm identifier in Table 4.

   When a particular Composite KEM OID is supported, an implementation
   MUST support the corresponding key-encryption algorithm identifier in
   Table 4.

   The following table lists the REQUIRED KDF and key-encryption
   algorithms to preserve security and performance characteristics of
   each composite algorithm.

   +===================================+==========+====================+

   +-----------------------------------+----------+--------------------+

              Table 4: REQUIRED pairings for CMS KDF and WRAP

   Note: id-aes256-Wrap is stronger than necessary for the MLKEM768
   combinations at the NIST level 3 192 bit security level, however id-
   aes256-Wrap was chosen because it has better general adoption than
   id-aes192-Wrap.

   where:

   *  SHA3-* KDF instantiations are defined in
      [I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-sha3-hash].

   *  id-aes*-Wrap are defined in [RFC3394].

6.2.  RecipientInfo Conventions

   When a composite KEM Algorithm is employed for a recipient, the
   RecipientInfo alternative for that recipient MUST be
   OtherRecipientInfo using the KEMRecipientInfo structure
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-kemri].  The fields of the KEMRecipientInfo MUST
   have the following values:

   version is the syntax version number; it MUST be 0.

   rid identifies the recipient's certificate or public key.

   kem identifies the KEM algorithm; it MUST contain one of the OIDs
   listed in Table 1.

   kemct is the ciphertext produced for this recipient; it contains the
   ct output from Encaps(pk) of the KEM algorithm identified in the kem
   parameter.

   kdf identifies the key-derivation function (KDF).  Note that the KDF
   used for CMS RecipientInfo process MAY be different than the KDF used
   within the composite KEM Algorithm, which MAY be different than the
   KDFs (if any) used within the component KEMs of the composite KEM
   Algorithm.

   kekLength is the size of the key-encryption key in octets.

   ukm is an optional random input to the key-derivation function.

   wrap identifies a key-encryption algorithm used to encrypt the keying
   material.

   encryptedKey is the result of encrypting the keying material with the
   key-encryption key.  When used with the CMS enveloped-data content
   type [RFC5652], the keying material is a content-encryption key.
   When used with the CMS authenticated-data content type [RFC5652], the
   keying material is a message-authentication key.  When used with the
   CMS authenticated-enveloped-data content type [RFC5083], the keying
   material is a content-authenticated-encryption key.

6.3.  Certificate Conventions

   The conventions specified in this section augment RFC 5280 [RFC5280].

   The willingness to accept a composite KEM Algorithm MAY be signaled
   by the use of the SMIMECapabilities Attribute as specified in
   Section 2.5.2. of [RFC8551] or the SMIMECapabilities certificate
   extension as specified in [RFC4262].

   The intended application for the public key MAY be indicated in the
   key usage certificate extension as specified in Section 4.2.1.3 of
   [RFC5280].  If the keyUsage extension is present in a certificate
   that conveys a composite KEM public key, then the key usage extension
   MUST contain only the following value:

   keyEncipherment

   The digitalSignature and dataEncipherment values MUST NOT be present.
   That is, a public key intended to be employed only with a composite
   KEM algorithm MUST NOT also be employed for data encryption or for
   digital signatures.  This requirement does not carry any particular
   security consideration; only the convention that KEM keys be
   identified with the keyEncipherment key usage.

6.4.  SMIMECapabilities Attribute Conventions

   Section 2.5.2 of [RFC8551] defines the SMIMECapabilities attribute to
   announce a partial list of algorithms that an S/MIME implementation
   can support.  When constructing a CMS signed-data content type
   [RFC5652], a compliant implementation MAY include the
   SMIMECapabilities attribute that announces support for the RSA-OAEP
   Algorithm.

   The SMIMECapability SEQUENCE representing a composite KEM Algorithm
   MUST include the appropriate object identifier as per Table 1 in the
   capabilityID field.

9.  Security Considerations

9.1.  Component Algorithm Selection Criteria

   The composite algorithm combinations defined in this document were
   chosen according to the following guidelines:

   1.  RSA combinations are provided at key sizes of 2048 and 3072 bits.
       Since RSA 2048 and 3072 are considered to have 112 and 128 bits
       of classical security respectively, they are both matched with
       NIST PQC Level 1 algorithms and 128-bit symmetric algorithms.

   2.  Elliptic curve algorithms are provided with combinations on each
       of the NIST [RFC6090], Brainpool [RFC5639], and Edwards [RFC7748]
       curves.  NIST PQC Levels 1 - 3 algorithms are matched with
       256-bit curves, while NIST levels 4 - 5 are matched with 384-bit
       elliptic curves.  This provides a balance between matching
       classical security levels of post-quantum and traditional
       algorithms, and also selecting elliptic curves which already have
       wide adoption.

   3.  NIST level 1 candidates are provided, matched with 256-bit
       elliptic curves, intended for constrained use cases.

   If other combinations are needed, a separate specification should be
   submitted to the IETF LAMPS working group.  To ease implementation,
   these specifications are encouraged to follow the construction
   pattern of the algorithms specified in this document.

   The composite structures defined in this specification allow only for
   pairs of algorithms.  This also does not preclude future
   specification from extending these structures to define combinations
   with three or more components.

9.2.  Policy for Deprecated and Acceptable Algorithms

   Traditionally, a public key or certificate contains a single
   cryptographic algorithm.  If and when an algorithm becomes deprecated
   (for example, RSA-512, or SHA1), it is obvious that the public keys
   or certificates using that algorithm are to be considered revoked.

   In the composite model this is less obvious since implementers may
   decide that certain cryptographic algorithms have complementary
   security properties and are acceptable in combination even though one
   or both algorithms are deprecated for individual use.  As such, a
   single composite public key or certificate may contain a mixture of
   deprecated and non-deprecated algorithms.

   Since composite algorithms are registered independently of their
   component algorithms, their deprecation can be handled independently
   from that of their component algorithms.  For example a cryptographic
   policy might continue to allow id-MLKEM512-ECDH-P256 even after
   ECDH-P256 is deprecated.

   The composite KEM design specified in this document, and especially
   that of the KEM combiner specified in Section 4.3 means that the
   overall composite KEM algorithm should be considered to have the
   security strength of the strongest of its component algorithms; ie as
   long as one component algorithm remains strong, then the overall
   composite algorithm remains strong.

9.3.  KEM Combiner Security Analysis

   TODO

   EDNOTE: the exact text to put here depends on the outcome of the CFRG
   KEM Combiners and X-Wing discussion.  If CFRG doesn't move fast
   enough for us, then we may need to leverage this security
   consideration directly on top of the X-Wing paper [X-Wing].

9.3.1.  Ciphertext collision resistance

   The notion of a ciphertext collision resistant KEM is defined in
   [X-Wing] being the property that it is computationally difficult to
   find two different ciphertexts that will decapsulate to the same
   shared secret under the same public key.  In [X-Wing] it is proven
   that ML-KEM has this property and therefore the ML-KEM ciphertext can
   safely be omitted from the KEM combiner.  Ciphertext collision
   resistance is not guaranteed for either RSA-OAEP or ECDH, therefore
   these ciphertexts are bound to the key derivation.

Appendix B.  Fixed Component Algorithm Identifiers

   The following table lists explicitly the DER encoded AlgorithmID that
   MUST be used when reconstructing SubjectPublicKeyInfo objects for
   each component public key, which may be required for example if
   cryptographic library requires the public key in this form in order
   to process each component algorithm.  The public key BIT STRING
   should be taken directly from the respective component of the
   CompositeKEMPublicKey.

Appendix C.  Implementation Considerations

C.1.  FIPS certification

   One of the primary design goals of this specification is for the
   overall composite algorithm to be able to be considered FIPS-approved
   even when one of the component algorithms is not.  The combiner
   presented in Section 4.3 was chosen to align with [SP.800-56Cr2] for
   this reason.

   Implementers seeking FIPS certification of a composite KEM algorithm
   where only one of the component algorithms has been FIPS-validated or
   FIPS-approved should credit the FIPS-validated component algorithm
   with full security strength, the non-FIPS-validated component
   algorithm with zero security, and the overall composite should be
   considered full strength and thus FIPS-approved.

   The authors wish to note that this gives composite algorithms great
   future utility both for future cryptographic migrations as well as
   bridging across jurisdictions; for example defining composite
   algorithms which combine FIPS cryptography with cryptography from a
   different national standards body.

C.1.1.  Compatibility with SP.800-56Cr2

   One of the primary NIST documents which is relevant for certification
   of a composite algorithm is NIST SP.800-56Cr2 [SP.800-56Cr2].
   Compliance is acheived in the following way:

   SP.800-56Cr2 section 4 "One-Step Key Derivation" requires a counter
   which begins at the 4-byte value 0x00000001.  However, the counter is
   allowed to be omitted when the hash function is executed only once,
   as specified on page 159 of the FIPS 140-3 Implementation Guidance
   [FIPS-140-3-IG].

   The HKDF-SHA2 options can be certified under SP.800-56Cr2 One-Step
   Key Derivation Option 1: H(x) = hash(x).

   The SHA3 options can be certified under SP.800-56Cr2 One-Step Key
   Derivation Option 2: H(x) = HMAC-hash(salt, x) with the salt omitted.

C.2.  Backwards Compatibility

   As noted in the introduction, the post-quantum cryptographic
   migration will face challenges in both ensuring cryptographic
   strength against adversaries of unknown capabilities, as well as
   providing ease of migration.  The composite mechanisms defined in
   this document primarily address cryptographic strength, however this
   section contains notes on how backwards compatibility may be
   obtained.

   The term "ease of migration" is used here to mean that existing
   systems can be gracefully transitioned to the new technology without
   requiring large service disruptions or expensive upgrades.  The term
   "backwards compatibility" is used here to mean something more
   specific; that existing systems as they are deployed today can inter-
   operate with the upgraded systems of the future.

   These migration and interoperability concerns need to be thought
   about in the context of various types of protocols that make use of
   X.509 and PKIX with relation to key establishment and content
   encryption, from online negotiated protocols such as TLS 1.3
   [RFC8446] and IKEv2 [RFC7296], to non-negotiated asynchronous
   protocols such as S/MIME signed email [RFC8551], as well as myriad
   other standardized and proprietary protocols and applications that
   leverage CMS [RFC5652] encrypted structures.

C.2.1.  Parallel PKIs

   EDNOTE: remove this section?

   We present the term "Parallel PKI" to refer to the setup where a PKI
   end entity possesses two or more distinct public keys or certificates
   for the same identity (name), but containing keys for different
   cryptographic algorithms.  One could imagine a set of parallel PKIs
   where an existing PKI using legacy algorithms (RSA, ECC) is left
   operational during the post-quantum migration but is shadowed by one
   or more parallel PKIs using pure post quantum algorithms or composite
   algorithms (legacy and post-quantum).

   Equipped with a set of parallel public keys in this way, a client
   would have the flexibility to choose which public key(s) or
   certificate(s) to use in a given signature operation.

   For negotiated protocols, the client could choose which public key(s)
   or certificate(s) to use based on the negotiated algorithms.

   For non-negotiated protocols, the details for obtaining backwards
   compatibility will vary by protocol, but for example in CMS
   [RFC5652].

   EDNOTE: I copied and pruned this text from I-D.ounsworth-pq-
   composite-sigs.  It probably needs to be fleshed out more as we
   better understand the implementation concerns around composite
   encryption.
