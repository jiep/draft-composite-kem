Composite ML-KEM for Use in the Internet X.509 Public Key Infrastructure
                                and CMS
                draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-kem-latest

Abstract

   This document defines Post-Quantum / Traditional composite Key
   Encapsulation Mechanism (KEM) algorithms suitable for use within
   X.509, PKIX and CMS protocols.  Composite algorithms are provided
   which combine ML-KEM with RSA-KEM and ECDH-KEM.  The provided set of
   composite algorithms should meet most Internet needs.

   This document assumes that all component algorithms are KEMs, and
   therefore it depends on [I-D.ietf-lamps-rfc5990bis] and
   [I-D.ounsworth-lamps-cms-dhkem] in order to promote RSA and ECDH
   respectively into KEMs.  For the purpose of combining KEMs, the
   combiner function from [I-D.ounsworth-cfrg-kem-combiners] is used.
   For use within CMS, this document is intended to be coupled with the
   CMS KEMRecipientInfo mechanism in [I-D.housley-lamps-cms-kemri].

1.  Changes in version -04

   *  Specified the fixedInfo domain separators as the DER encoded
      object identifiers

   Still to do in a future version:

   [ ] We need PEM samples ... 118 hackathon?  OQS friends?  David @ BC?
   The right format for samples is probably to follow the hackathon ...
   a Dilithium or ECDSA trust anchor certificate, a composite KEM end
   entity certificate, and a CMS EnvolepedData sample encrypted for that
   composite KEM certificate.

2.  Introduction

   The migration to post-quantum cryptography is unique in the history
   of modern digital cryptography in that neither the old outgoing nor
   the new incoming algorithms are fully trusted to protect data for
   long data lifetimes.  The outgoing algorithms, such as RSA and
   elliptic curve, may fall to quantum cryptalanysis, while the incoming
   post-quantum algorithms face uncertainty about both the underlying
   mathematics falling to classical algorithmic attacks as well as
   hardware and software implementations that have not had sufficient
   maturing time to rule out catastrophic implementation bugs.  Unlike
   previous cryptographic algorithm migrations, the choice of when to
   migrate and which algorithms to migrate to, is not so clear.

   Cautious implementers may wish to combine cryptographic algorithms
   such that an attacker would need to break all of them in order to
   compromise the data being protected.  Such mechanisms are referred to
   as Post-Quantum / Traditional Hybrids
   [I-D.driscoll-pqt-hybrid-terminology].

   In particular, certain jurisdictions are recommending or requiring
   that PQC lattice schemes only be used within a PQ/T hybrid.  As an
   example, we point to [BSI2021] which includes the following
   recommendation:

   "Therefore, quantum computer-resistant methods should not be used
   alone - at least in a transitional period - but only in hybrid mode,
   i.e. in combination with a classical method.  For this purpose,
   protocols must be modified or supplemented accordingly.  In addition,
   public key infrastructures, for example, must also be adapted"

   In addition, [BSI2021] specifically references this specification as
   a concrete example of hybrid X.509 certificates.

   A more recent example is [ANSSI2024], a document co-authored by
   French Cybersecurity Agency (ANSSI), Federal Office for Information
   Security (BSI), Netherlands National Communications Security Agency
   (NLNCSA), and Swedish National Communications Security Authority,
   Swedish Armed Forces which makes the following statement:

   "In light of the urgent need to stop relying only on quantum-
   vulnerable public-key cryptography for key establishment, the clear
   priority should therefore be the migration to post-quantum
   cryptography in hybrid solutions"

   This specification represents the straightforward implementation of
   the hybrid solutions called for by European cyber security agencies.

   PQ/T Hybrid cryptography can, in general, provide solutions to two
   migration problems:

   *  Algorithm strength uncertainty: During the transition period, some
      post-quantum signature and encryption algorithms will not be fully
      trusted, while also the trust in legacy public key algorithms will
      start to erode.  A relying party may learn some time after
      deployment that a public key algorithm has become untrustworthy,
      but in the interim, they may not know which algorithm an adversary
      has compromised.

   *  Ease-of-migration: During the transition period, systems will
      require mechanisms that allow for staged migrations from fully
      classical to fully post-quantum-aware cryptography.

   This document defines a specific instantiation of the PQ/T Hybrid
   paradigm called "composite" where multiple cryptographic algorithms
   are combined to form a single key encapsulation mechanism (KEM) key
   and ciphertext such that they can be treated as a single atomic
   algorithm at the protocol level.  Composite algorithms address
   algorithm strength uncertainty because the composite algorithm
   remains strong so long as one of its components remains strong.
   Concrete instantiations of composite KEM algorithms are provided
   based on ML-KEM, RSA-KEM and ECDH-KEM.  Backwards compatibility is
   not directly covered in this document, but is the subject of
   Appendix B.2.

   This document is intended for general applicability anywhere that key
   establishment or enveloped content encryption is used within PKIX or
   CMS structures.

2.1.  Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in BCP
   14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.

   This document is consistent with all terminology from
   [I-D.driscoll-pqt-hybrid-terminology].  In addition, the following
   terms are used in this document:

   *COMBINER:* A combiner specifies how multiple shared secrets are
   combined into a single shared secret.

   *DER:* Distinguished Encoding Rules as defined in [X.690].

   *KEM:* A key encapsulation mechanism as defined in Section 2.3.

   *PKI:* Public Key Infrastructure, as defined in [RFC5280].

   *SHARED SECRET:* A value established between two communicating
   parties for use as cryptographic key material, but which cannot be
   learned by an active or passive adversary.  This document is
   concerned with shared secrets established via public key
   cryptographic operations.

2.2.  Composite Design Philosophy

   [I-D.driscoll-pqt-hybrid-terminology] defines composites as:

      _Composite Cryptographic Element_: A cryptographic element that
      incorporates multiple component cryptographic elements of the same
      type in a multi-algorithm scheme.

   Composite keys as defined here follow this definition and should be
   regarded as a single key that performs a single cryptographic
   operation such key generation, signing, verifying, encapsulating, or
   decapsulating -- using its internal sequence of component keys as if
   they form a single key.  This generally means that the complexity of
   combining algorithms can and should be handled by the cryptographic
   library or cryptographic module, and the single composite public key,
   private key, and ciphertext can be carried in existing fields in
   protocols such as PKCS#10 [RFC2986], CMP [RFC4210], X.509 [RFC5280],
   CMS [RFC5652], and the Trust Anchor Format [RFC5914].  In this way,
   composites achieve "protocol backwards-compatibility" in that they
   will drop cleanly into any protocol that accepts KEM algorithms
   without requiring any modification of the protocol to handle multiple
   keys.

2.3.  Composite Key Encapsulation Mechanisms (KEMs)

   We borrow here the definition of a key encapsulation mechanism (KEM)
   from [I-D.ietf-tls-hybrid-design], in which a KEM is a cryptographic
   primitive that consists of three algorithms:

   *  KeyGen() -> (pk, sk): A probabilistic key generation algorithm,
      which generates a public key pk and a secret key sk.

   *  Encaps(pk) -> (ct, ss): A probabilistic encapsulation algorithm,
      which takes as input a public key pk and outputs a ciphertext ct
      and shared secret ss.

   *  Decaps(sk, ct) -> ss: A decapsulation algorithm, which takes as
      input a secret key sk and ciphertext ct and outputs a shared
      secret ss, or in some cases a distinguished error value.

   The KEM interface defined above differs from both traditional key
   transport mechanism (for example for use with KeyTransRecipientInfo
   defined in [RFC5652]), and key agreement (for example for use with
   KeyAgreeRecipientInfo defined in [RFC5652]).

   The KEM interface was chosen as the interface for a composite key
   establishment because it allows for arbitrary combinations of
   component algorithm types since both key transport and key agreement
   mechanisms can be promoted into KEMs.  This specification uses the
   Post-Quantum KEM ML-KEM as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-kyber-certificates] and [FIPS.203-ipd].  For
   Traditional KEMs, this document relies on the RSA-KEM construction
   defined in [I-D.ietf-lamps-rfc5990bis] and the Elliptic Curve DHKEM
   defined in [I-D.ounsworth-lamps-cms-dhkem].

   A composite KEM allows two or more underlying key transport, key
   agreement, or KEM algorithms to be combined into a single
   cryptographic operation by performing each operation, transformed to
   a KEM as outline above, and using a specified combiner function to
   combine the two or more component shared secrets into a single shared
   secret.

2.3.1.  Composite KeyGen

   The KeyGen() -> (pk, sk) of a composite KEM algorithm will perform
   the KeyGen() of the respective component KEM algorithms and it
   produces a composite public key pk as per Section 3.2 and a composite
   secret key sk is per Section 3.3.

2.3.2.  Composite Encaps

   The Encaps(pk) -> (ct, ss) of a composite KEM algorithm is defined
   as:

   Encaps(pk):
     # Split the component public keys
     pk1 = pk[0]
     pk2 = pk[1]

     # Perform the respective component Encaps operations
     (ct1, ss1) = ComponentKEM1.Encaps(pk1)
     (ct2, ss2) = ComponentKEM2.Encaps(pk2)

     # combine
     ct = CompositeCiphertextValue(ct1, ct2)
     ss = Combiner(ct1, ss1, ct2, ss2, algName)

     return (ct, ss)

                       Figure 1: Composite Encaps(pk)

   where Combiner(ct1, ss1, ct2, ss2, fixedInfo) is defined in
   Section 4.3 and CompositeCiphertextValue is defined in Section 4.2.

2.3.3.  Composite Decaps

   The Decaps(sk, ct) -> ss of a composite KEM algorithm is defined as:

   Decaps(sk, ct):
     # Sptil the component ciphertexts
     ct1 = ct[0]
     ct2 = ct[1]

     # Perform the respective component Decaps operations
     ss1 = ComponentKEM1.Encaps(sk1, ct1)
     ss2 = ComponentKEM2.Encaps(sk2, ct2)

     # combine
     ss = Combiner(ct1, ss1, ct2, ss2, algName)

     return ss

                     Figure 2: Composite Decaps(sk, ct)

   where Combiner(ct1, ss1, ct2, ss2, fixedInfo) is defined in {sec-kem-
   combiner}.

2.4.  Component Algorithm Selection Criteria

   The composite algorithm combinations defined in this document were
   chosen according to the following guidelines:

   1.  RSA combinations are provided at key sizes of 2048 and 3072 bits.
       Since RSA 2048 and 3072 are considered to have 112 and 128 bits
       of classical security respectively, they are both matched with
       NIST PQC Level 1 algorithms and 128-bit symmetric algorithms.

   2.  Elliptic curve algorithms are provided with combinations on each
       of the NIST [RFC6090], Brainpool [RFC5639], and Edwards [RFC7748]
       curves.  NIST PQC Levels 1 - 3 algorithms are matched with
       256-bit curves, while NIST levels 4 - 5 are matched with 384-bit
       elliptic curves.  This provides a balance between matching
       classical security levels of post-quantum and traditional
       algorithms, and also selecting elliptic curves which already have
       wide adoption.

   3.  NIST level 1 candidates are provided, matched with 256-bit
       elliptic curves, intended for constrained use cases.

   If other combinations are needed, a separate specification should be
   submitted to the IETF LAMPS working group.  To ease implementation,
   these specifications are encouraged to follow the construction
   pattern of the algorithms specified in this document.

   The composite structures defined in this specification allow only for
   pairs of algorithms.  This also does not preclude future
   specification from extending these structures to define combinations
   with three or more components.

2.5.  Domain Separators

   In section Section 4.3 the fixedInfo value is defined as the DER
   encoding of the OID and is used as a domain separator for the
   Composite KEM combiner.  The following table shows the HEX encoding
   for each Composite KEM AlgorithmID.

3.  Composite Key Structures

3.1.  pk-CompositeKEM

   The following ASN.1 Information Object Class is a template to be used
   in defining all composite KEM public key types.

   pk-CompositeKEM {
     OBJECT IDENTIFIER:id, FirstPublicKeyType,
     SecondPublicKeyType} PUBLIC-KEY ::=
     {
       IDENTIFIER id
       KEY SEQUENCE {
        BIT STRING (CONTAINING FirstPublicKeyType)
        BIT STRING (CONTAINING SecondPublicKeyType)
       }
       PARAMS ARE absent
       CERT-KEY-USAGE { keyEncipherment }
     }

   As an example, the public key type pk-MLKEM512-ECDH-P256-KMAC128 is
   defined as:

   pk-MLKEM512-ECDH-P256-KMAC128 PUBLIC-KEY ::=
     pk-CompositeKEM {
       id-MLKEM512-ECDH-P256-KMAC128,
       OCTET STRING, ECPoint }

   The full set of key types defined by this specification can be found
   in the ASN.1 Module in Section 8.

3.2.  CompositeKEMPublicKey

   Composite public key data is represented by the following structure:

   CompositeKEMPublicKey ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2) OF BIT STRING

   A composite key MUST contain two component public keys.  The order of
   the component keys is determined by the definition of the
   corresponding algorithm identifier as defined in section Section 6.

   Some applications may need to reconstruct the SubjectPublicKeyInfo
   objects corresponding to each component public key.  Table 3 in
   Section 6 provides the necessary mapping between composite and their
   component algorithms for doing this reconstruction.  This also
   motivates the design choice of SEQUENCE OF BIT STRING instead of
   SEQUENCE OF OCTET STRING; using BIT STRING allows for easier
   transcription between CompositeKEMPublicKey and SubjectPublicKeyInfo.

   When the CompositeKEMPublicKey must be provided in octet string or
   bit string format, the data structure is encoded as specified in
   Section 3.4.

3.3.  CompositeKEMPrivateKey

   Usecases that require an interoperable encoding for composite private
   keys, such as when private keys are carried in PKCS #12 [RFC7292],
   CMP [RFC4210] or CRMF [RFC4211] MUST use the following structure.

   CompositeKEMPrivateKey ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2) OF OneAsymmetricKey

   Each element is a OneAsymmetricKey` [RFC5958] object for a component
   private key.

   The parameters field MUST be absent.

   The order of the component keys is the same as the order defined in
   Section 3.2 for the components of CompositeKEMPublicKey.

   When a CompositePrivateKey is conveyed inside a OneAsymmetricKey
   structure (version 1 of which is also known as PrivateKeyInfo)
   [RFC5958], the privateKeyAlgorithm field SHALL be set to the
   corresponding composite algorithm identifier defined according to
   Section 6, the privateKey field SHALL contain the
   CompositeKEMPrivateKey, and the publicKey field MUST NOT be present.
   Associated public key material MAY be present in the
   CompositeKEMPrivateKey.

   In some usecases the private keys that comprise a composite key may
   not be represented in a single structure or even be contained in a
   single cryptographic module; for example if one component is within
   the FIPS boundary of a cryptographic module and the other is not; see
   {sec-fips} for more discussion.  The establishment of correspondence
   between public keys in a CompositeKEMPublicKey and private keys not
   represented in a single composite structure is beyond the scope of
   this document.

3.4.  Encoding Rules

   Many protocol specifications will require that the composite public
   key and composite private key data structures be represented by an
   octet string or bit string.

   When an octet string is required, the DER encoding of the composite
   data structure SHALL be used directly.

   CompositeKEMPublicKeyOs ::= OCTET STRING (CONTAINING CompositeKEMPublicKey ENCODED BY der)

   When a bit string is required, the octets of the DER encoded
   composite data structure SHALL be used as the bits of the bit string,
   with the most significant bit of the first octet becoming the first
   bit, and so on, ending with the least significant bit of the last
   octet becoming the last bit of the bit string.

   CompositeKEMPublicKeyBs ::= BIT STRING (CONTAINING CompositeKEMPublicKey ENCODED BY der)

3.5.  Key Usage Bits

   For protocols such as X.509 [RFC5280] that specify key usage along
   with the public key, then the composite public key associated with a
   composite KEM algorithm MUST contain only a keyEncipherment key
   usage, all other key usages MUST NOT be used.  This is because the
   composite public key can only be used in situations that are
   appropriate for both component algorithms, so even if the classical
   component key supports both signing and encryption, the post-quantum
   algorithms do not.

4.  Composite KEM Structures

4.1.  kema-CompositeKEM

   The ASN.1 algorithm object for a composite KEM is:

   kema-CompositeKEM {
     OBJECT IDENTIFIER:id,
       PUBLIC-KEY:publicKeyType }
       KEM-ALGORITHM ::= {
            IDENTIFIER id
            VALUE CompositeCiphertextValue
            PARAMS ARE absent
            PUBLIC-KEYS { publicKeyType }
           }

4.2.  CompositeCiphertextValue

   The compositeCipherTextValue is a concatenation of the ciphertexts of
   the underlying component algorithms.  It is represented in ASN.1 as
   follows:

   CompositeCiphertextValue ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2) OF OCTET STRING

   A composite KEM and CompositeCipherTextValue MAY be associated with a
   composite KEM public key, but MAY also be associated with multiple
   public keys from different sources, for example multiple X.509
   certificates, or multiple cryptographic modules.  In the latter case,
   composite KEMs MAY be used as the mechanism for carrying multiple
   ciphertexts, for example, in a non-composite hybrid encryption
   equivalent of those described for digital signatures in
   [I-D.becker-guthrie-noncomposite-hybrid-auth].

4.3.  KEM Combiner

   TODO: as per https://www.enisa.europa.eu/publications/post-quantum-
   cryptography-integration-study section 4.2, might need to specify
   behaviour in light of KEMs with a non-zero failure probability.

   This document follows the construction of
   [I-D.ounsworth-cfrg-kem-combiners], which is repeated here for
   clarity and simplified to take two input shared secrets:

   Combiner(ct1, ss1, ct2, ss2, fixedInfo) =
     KDF(counter || ct1 || ss1 || ct2 || ss2 || fixedInfo, outputBits)

                Figure 3: Generic KEM combiner construction

   where:

   *  KDF(message, outputBits) represents a hash function suitable to
      the chosen KEMs according to {tab-kem-combiners}.

   *  fixedInfo SHALL be the DER encoded value of the object identifier
      of the composite KEM algorithm as listed in Section 2.5.

   *  counter SHALL be the fixed 32-bit value 0x00000001 which is placed
      here solely for the purposes of easy compliance with
      [SP.800-56Cr2].

   *  || represents concatenation.

   Each registered composite KEM algorithm must specify the choice of
   KDF, fixedInfo, and outputBits to be used.

   See Section 10.2 for further discussion of the security
   considerations of this KEM combiner.

4.3.1.  KMAC-KDF

   KMAC128-KDF and KMAC256-KDF are KMAC-based KDFs specified for use in
   CMS in [I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-sha3-hash].  Here, KMAC# indicates the use
   of either KMAC128-KDF or KMAC256-KDF.

   KMAC#(K, X, L, S) takes the following parameters:

      K: the input key-derivation key.  In this document this is the
      shared secret outputted from the Encapsulate() or Decapsulate()
      functions.  This corresponds to the IKM KDF input from Section 5
      of [I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-kemri].

      X: the context, which is the info KDF input.

      L: the output length, in bits.

      S: the optional customization label.  In this document this
      parameter is unused, that is it is the zero-length string "".

   The object identifier for KMAC128-KDF is id-kmac128 as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-sha3-hash].

   The object identifier for KMAC256-KDF is id-kmac256 as defined in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-sha3-hash].

   Since the customization label to KMAC# is not used, the parameter
   field MUST be absent when id-kmac128 or id-kmac256 is used as part of
   an algorithm identifier specifying the KDF to use for ML-KEM in
   KemRecipientInfo.

   This specification references KEM combiner instantiations according
   to the following names:

              +===================+============+============+
              | KEM Combiner Name | KDF        | outputBits |
              +===================+============+============+
              | KMAC128/256       | id-kmac128 | 256        |
              +-------------------+------------+------------+
              | KMAC256/384       | id-kmac256 | 384        |
              +-------------------+------------+------------+
              | KMAC256/512       | id-kmac256 | 512        |
              +-------------------+------------+------------+

                           Table 2: KEM Combiners

   BEGIN EDNOTE

   these choices are somewhat arbitrary but aiming to match security
   level of the input KEMs.  Feedback welcome.

   *  ML-KEM-512: KMAC128/256

   *  ML-KEM-768: KMAC256/384

   *  ML-KEM-1024 KMAC256/512

   END EDNOTE

5.  Example KEM Combiner instantiation

   For example, the KEM combiner used with the first entry of Table 3,
   id-MLKEM512-ECDH-P256-KMAC128 would be:

   Combiner(ct1, ss1, ct2, ss2, "id-MLKEM512-ECDH-P256-KMAC128") =
              KMAC128( 0x00000001 || ss_1 || ss_2 ||
                 "id-MLKEM512-ECDH-P256-KMAC128", 256, "")

6.  Algorithm Identifiers

   This table summarizes the list of composite KEM algorithms and lists
   the OID, two component algorithms, and the combiner function.

   EDNOTE: The OID referenced are TBD and MUST be used only for
   prototyping and replaced with the final IANA-assigned OIDS.  The
   following prefix is used for each: replace <CompKEM> with the String
   "2.16.840.1.114027.80.5.2".

   TODO: OIDs to be replaced by IANA.

   Therefore <CompKEM>.1 is equal to 2.16.840.1.114027.80.5.2.1

                      Table 3: Composite KEM key types

   The table above contains everything needed to implement the listed
   explicit composite algorithms, with the exception of some special
   notes found below in this section.  See the ASN.1 module in section
   Section 8 for the explicit definitions of the above Composite
   signature algorithms.

   Full specifications for the referenced algorithms can be found as
   follows:

   *  _ECDH_: There does not appear to be a single IETF definition of
      ECDH, so we refer to the following:

      -  _ECDH NIST_: SHALL be Elliptic Curve Cryptography Cofactor
         Diffie-Hellman (ECC CDH) as defined in section 5.7.1.2 of
         [SP.800-56Ar3].

      -  _ECDH BSI / brainpool_: SHALL be Elliptic Curve Key Agreement
         algorithm (ECKA) as defined in section 4.3.1 of [BSI-ECC]

   *  _ML-KEM_: [I-D.ietf-lamps-kyber-certificates] and [FIPS.203-ipd]

   *  _RSA-KEM_: [I-D.ietf-lamps-rfc5990bis]

   *  _X25519 / X448_: [RFC8410]

   Note that all ECDH as well as X25519 and X448 algorithms MUST be
   promoted into KEMs according to [I-D.ounsworth-lamps-cms-dhkem].

   EDNOTE: I believe that [SP.800-56Ar3] and [BSI-ECC] give equivalent
   and interoperable algorithms, so maybe this is extraneous detail to
   include?

   The "KEM Combiner" column refers to the definitions in Section 4.3.

6.1.  RSA-KEM Parameters

   Use of RSA-KEM [I-D.ietf-lamps-rfc5990bis] within id-
   MLKEM512-RSA2048-KMAC128 and id-MLKEM512-RSA3072-KMAC128 requires
   additional specification.

   The RSA component keys MUST be generated at the 2048-bit and 3072-bit
   security level respectively.

   As with the other composite KEM algorithms, when id-
   MLKEM512-RSA2048-KMAC128 or id-MLKEM512-RSA3072-KMAC128 is used in an
   AlgorithmIdentifier, the parameters MUST be absent.  The RSA-KEM
   SHALL be instantiated with the following parameters:

           +=======================+===========================+
           | RSA-KEM Parameter     | Value                     |
           +=======================+===========================+
           | keyDerivationFunction | kda-kdf3 with id-sha3-256 |
           +-----------------------+---------------------------+
           | keyLength             | 128                       |
           +-----------------------+---------------------------+

                      Table 4: RSA-KEM 2048 Parameters

   where:

   *  kda-kdf3 is defined in [I-D.ietf-lamps-rfc5990bis] which
      references it from [ANS-X9.44].

   *  id-sha3-256 is defined in [I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-sha3-hash] which
      references it from [SHA3].

7.  Use in CMS

   [EDNOTE: The convention in LAMPS is to specify algorithms and their
   CMS conventions in separate documents.  Here we have presented them
   in the same document, but this section has been written so that it
   can easily be moved to a standalone document.]

   Composite KEM algorithms MAY be employed for one or more recipients
   in the CMS enveloped-data content type [RFC5652], the CMS
   authenticated-data content type [RFC5652], or the CMS authenticated-
   enveloped-data content type [RFC5083].  In each case, the
   KEMRecipientInfo [I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-kemri] is used with the chosen
   composite KEM Algorithm to securely transfer the content-encryption
   key from the originator to the recipient.

7.1.  Underlying Components

   A CMS implementation that supports a composite KEM algorithm MUST
   support at least the following underlying components:

   When a particular Composite KEM OID is supported, an implementation
   MUST support the corresponding KDF algorithm identifier in Table 5.

   When a particular Composite KEM OID is supported, an implementation
   MUST support the corresponding key-encryption algorithm identifier in
   Table 5.

   The following table lists the REQUIRED KDF and key-encryption
   algorithms to preserve security and performance characteristics of
   each composite algorithm.

   +===============================+=============+====================+

             Table 5: REQUIRED pairings for CMS KDF and WRAP

   where:

   *  KMAC KDF instantiations are defined in Section 4.3.1.

   *  id-aes*-Wrap are defined in [RFC3394].

7.2.  RecipientInfo Conventions

   When a composite KEM Algorithm is employed for a recipient, the
   RecipientInfo alternative for that recipient MUST be
   OtherRecipientInfo using the KEMRecipientInfo structure
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-cms-kemri].  The fields of the KEMRecipientInfo MUST
   have the following values:

   version is the syntax version number; it MUST be 0.

   rid identifies the recipient's certificate or public key.

   kem identifies the KEM algorithm; it MUST contain one of the OIDs
   listed in Table 3.

   kemct is the ciphertext produced for this recipient; it contains the
   ct output from Encaps(pk) of the KEM algorithm identified in the kem
   parameter.

   kdf identifies the key-derivation function (KDF).  Note that the KDF
   used for CMS RecipientInfo process MAY be different than the KDF used
   within the composite KEM Algorithm, which MAY be different than the
   KDFs (if any) used within the component KEMs of the composite KEM
   Algorithm.

   kekLength is the size of the key-encryption key in octets.

   ukm is an optional random input to the key-derivation function.

   wrap identifies a key-encryption algorithm used to encrypt the keying
   material.

   encryptedKey is the result of encrypting the keying material with the
   key-encryption key.  When used with the CMS enveloped-data content
   type [RFC5652], the keying material is a content-encryption key.
   When used with the CMS authenticated-data content type [RFC5652], the
   keying material is a message-authentication key.  When used with the
   CMS authenticated-enveloped-data content type [RFC5083], the keying
   material is a content-authenticated-encryption key.

7.3.  Certificate Conventions

   The conventions specified in this section augment RFC 5280 [RFC5280].

   The willingness to accept a composite KEM Algorithm MAY be signaled
   by the use of the SMIMECapabilities Attribute as specified in
   Section 2.5.2. of [RFC8551] or the SMIMECapabilities certificate
   extension as specified in [RFC4262].

   The intended application for the public key MAY be indicated in the
   key usage certificate extension as specified in Section 4.2.1.3 of
   [RFC5280].  If the keyUsage extension is present in a certificate
   that conveys a composite KEM public key, then the key usage extension
   MUST contain only the following value:

   keyEncipherment

   The digitalSignature and dataEncipherment values MUST NOT be present.
   That is, a public key intended to be employed only with a composite
   KEM algorithm MUST NOT also be employed for data encryption or for
   digital signatures.  This requirement does not carry any particular
   security consideration; only the convention that KEM keys be
   identified with the keyEncipherment key usage.

7.4.  SMIMECapabilities Attribute Conventions

   Section 2.5.2 of [RFC8551] defines the SMIMECapabilities attribute to
   announce a partial list of algorithms that an S/MIME implementation
   can support.  When constructing a CMS signed-data content type
   [RFC5652], a compliant implementation MAY include the
   SMIMECapabilities attribute that announces support for the RSA-KEM
   Algorithm.

   The SMIMECapability SEQUENCE representing a composite KEM Algorithm
   MUST include the appropriate object identifier as per Table 3 in the
   capabilityID field.

10.  Security Considerations

10.1.  Policy for Deprecated and Acceptable Algorithms

   Traditionally, a public key or certificate contains a single
   cryptographic algorithm.  If and when an algorithm becomes deprecated
   (for example, RSA-512, or SHA1), it is obvious that the public keys
   or certificates using that algorithm are to be considered revoked.

   In the composite model this is less obvious since implementers may
   decide that certain cryptographic algorithms have complementary
   security properties and are acceptable in combination even though one
   or both algorithms are deprecated for individual use.  As such, a
   single composite public key or certificate may contain a mixture of
   deprecated and non-deprecated algorithms.

   Since composite algorithms are registered independently of their
   component algorithms, their deprecation can be handled independently
   from that of their component algorithms.  For example a cryptographic
   policy might continue to allow id-MLKEM512-ECDH-P256-KMAC128 even
   after ECDH-P256 is deprecated.

   The composite KEM design specified in this document, and especially
   that of the KEM combiner specified in Section 4.3 means that the
   overall composite KEM algorithm should be considered to have the
   security strength of the strongest of its component algorithms; ie as
   long as one component algorithm remains strong, then the overall
   composite algorithm remains strong.

10.2.  KEM Combiner

   This document uses directly the KEM Combiner defined in
   [I-D.ounsworth-cfrg-kem-combiners] and therefore IND-CCA2 of any of
   its ingredient KEMs, i.e. the newly formed combined KEM is IND-CCA2
   secure as long as at least one of the ingredient KEMs is

   [I-D.ounsworth-cfrg-kem-combiners] provides two different
   constructions depending on the properties of the component KEMs:

      If both the secret share ss_i and the ciphertext ct_i are constant
      length, then k_i MAY be constructed concatenating the two values.
      If ss_i or ct_i are not guaranteed to have constant length, it is
      REQUIRED to append the rlen encoded length when concatenating,
      prior to inclusion in the overall construction.

   The component KEMs used in this specification are RSA-KEM
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-rfc5990bis], ECDH KEM [I-D.ounsworth-lamps-cms-dhkem]
   and ML-KEM [FIPS.203-ipd] all of which meet the criteria of having
   constant-length shared secrets and ciphertexts and therefore we
   justify using the simpler construction that omits the length tag.

Appendix B.  Implementation Considerations

B.1.  FIPS certification

   One of the primary design goals of this specification is for the
   overall composite algorithm to be able to be considered FIPS-approved
   even when one of the component algorithms is not.  The combiner
   presented in Section 4.3 was chosen to align with [SP.800-56Cr2] for
   this reason.

   Implementers seeking FIPS certification of a composite KEM algorithm
   where only one of the component algorithms has been FIPS-validated or
   FIPS-approved should credit the FIPS-validated component algorithm
   with full security strength, the non-FIPS-validated component
   algorithm with zero security, and the overall composite should be
   considered full strength and thus FIPS-approved.

   The authors wish to note that this gives composite algorithms great
   future utility both for future cryptographic migrations as well as
   bridging across jurisdictions; for example defining composite
   algorithms which combine FIPS cryptography with cryptography from a
   different national standards body.

B.2.  Backwards Compatibility

   As noted in the introduction, the post-quantum cryptographic
   migration will face challenges in both ensuring cryptographic
   strength against adversaries of unknown capabilities, as well as
   providing ease of migration.  The composite mechanisms defined in
   this document primarily address cryptographic strength, however this
   section contains notes on how backwards compatibility may be
   obtained.

   The term "ease of migration" is used here to mean that existing
   systems can be gracefully transitioned to the new technology without
   requiring large service disruptions or expensive upgrades.  The term
   "backwards compatibility" is used here to mean something more
   specific; that existing systems as they are deployed today can
   interoperate with the upgraded systems of the future.

   These migration and interoperability concerns need to be thought
   about in the context of various types of protocols that make use of
   X.509 and PKIX with relation to key establishment and content
   encryption, from online negotiated protocols such as TLS 1.3
   [RFC8446] and IKEv2 [RFC7296], to non-negotiated asynchronous
   protocols such as S/MIME signed email [RFC8551], as well as myriad
   other standardized and proprietary protocols and applications that
   leverage CMS [RFC5652] encrypted structures.

B.2.1.  Parallel PKIs

   EDNOTE: remove this section?

   We present the term "Parallel PKI" to refer to the setup where a PKI
   end entity possesses two or more distinct public keys or certificates
   for the same identity (name), but containing keys for different
   cryptographic algorithms.  One could imagine a set of parallel PKIs
   where an existing PKI using legacy algorithms (RSA, ECC) is left
   operational during the post-quantum migration but is shadowed by one
   or more parallel PKIs using pure post quantum algorithms or composite
   algorithms (legacy and post-quantum).

   Equipped with a set of parallel public keys in this way, a client
   would have the flexibility to choose which public key(s) or
   certificate(s) to use in a given signature operation.

   For negotiated protocols, the client could choose which public key(s)
   or certificate(s) to use based on the negotiated algorithms.

   For non-negotiated protocols, the details for obtaining backwards
   compatibility will vary by protocol, but for example in CMS
   [RFC5652].

   EDNOTE: I copied and pruned this text from I-D.ounsworth-pq-
   composite-sigs.  It probably needs to be fleshed out more as we
   better understand the implementation concerns around composite
   encryption.
